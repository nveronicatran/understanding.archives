<h3>About the Website</h3>
<p>
Understanding Archives is a repository used to contextualise a master thesis project by <a href="https://www.nveronicatran.com">Veronica Tran</a> during her time at IaaC / Elisava's 'Master in Design for Emergent Futures'. The site is built entirely with open-source and free tools. The site uses Jekyll, an open-source, static-site generator, and is hosted on Github. It is set in Cooper Hewitt typeface licensed under the SIL Open Font License. The design is forked from Jarret Fuller's <a href="https://github.com/jarrettfuller/Graphic-Design-Readings">Graphic Design Readings</a>.

<h3>On Museums</h3>
<p>Museums as institutions have stayed static as the world around it has radically shifted. They are spaces that aestheticize and embody the interaction between people and information. A ‘museum without walls’ is a phrase that dates back to Andre Malraux, and the potential of a distributed, internationalist museum ‘collection of collections’ becomes more possible now with digital technologies. What are the new ways to write our urban data and cultural history, and how can we equip people for that?
